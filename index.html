      <h4>Overview:</h3>
      <p>UX (user experience) designers aims for the accessibility and ease-of-use of their users. A good UX-design-based website is efficient for users and increases satisfaction when viewing products and services that may be available. A bad UX-design based-website will do the opposite. Between battling the layout of the webpage to find what they need and the inconsistent layouts between different sections, users would no longer enjoy viewing and interacting with your webpage. The box model splits webpages into many sections, or boxes, that are able to be independently styled (such as this one). The box model can add consistency between different sections of your webpage depending on how you choose to style your elements.</p>

    <div id="what-is-tbm" class="">
      <h4>What Is The Box Model?:</h3>
      <p>The box model is used on <span class="italics">almost</span> every webpage, if you’ve ever set the background color or aligned text, you may have had the color covering more than you wanted or the text not aligning to the center of the screen, but rather something else. That is the box model at work. Using any sort of container or block element

      <span>(such as <span class="example"><span><</span>p></span> or <span class="example"><span><</span>div></span>)

      means that you are using the box model. The box model ultimately aligns your webpage like building blocks, and you can change the width and height or your blocks to let them fit in place next to each other. Every block element takes up the full width of a screen when not constrained by a width element. All elements are interpreted as being housed inside these building blocks.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="how-does-tmai" class="">
      <h4>How Does This Make An Impact?:</h3>
      <p>The box model creates a flow in webpages and contained elements. It helps lead the user to what they’re searching for by utilising space and colors. This can help those who lose focus on things arbitrarily regain focus to the same spot or lessen how often focus is lost.</p>
